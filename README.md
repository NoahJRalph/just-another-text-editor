## Description

My very own Text Editor PWA, allowing for text editing either online or offline desktop use via installing the application using your favorite browser.

Made using the criteria from Module 19 of my edX Web Development bootcamp. I made it as compact as possible within my tight time limit I had.

The application was built using JS, CSS, HTML, and Node.js. JATE uses IndexedDB to store and access information, Webpack for PWA packaging, and Express for server deployment. JATE also caches data when the window is minimized for easy data access.

## Installation

Not necessary. Access via the deployed heroku link.

## Usage
 
0. Access the deployed program via the heroku link.
1. Interact with the program via entering text, I would recommend JS code, as the program can assist visually with syntax via font coloring.
2. To install the program for offline use, hit the install button on a commonly supported browser.
3. Open the program locally in offline-mode via the program shortcut deployed on your desktop.
4. To uninstall, hit the 3-dots icon in the upper right hand corner, and select "Uninstall J.A.T.E.". Follow the prompts to uninstall.
